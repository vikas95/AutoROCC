of several bikini-clad Sports Illustrated models.<br><b>Sent 2: </b>View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers.<br><b>Sent 3: </b>The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\"<br><b>Sent 4: </b>The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun.<br><b>Sent 5: </b>It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise.<br><b>Sent 6: </b>Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers.<br><b>Sent 7: </b>The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes.<br><b>Sent 8: </b>Christie Brinkley makes a cameo.<br><b>Sent 9: </b>\"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald.<br><b>Sent 10: </b>Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it.<br><b>Sent 11: </b>Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video.<br><b>Sent 12: </b>From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past.<br>","questions":[{"question":"Who were the people that opposed Air New Zealand's decisions?","sentences_used":[11,8],"answers":[{"text":"Deborah Russel
